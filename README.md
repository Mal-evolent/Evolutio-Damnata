# Overview

Evolutio Damnata is a mobile-first roguelike deckbuilder set in a grimdark world where players fight for forbidden power through tactical card-based combat. Built in Unity, the game combines strategic deck construction, phase-based battles, and a modular AI system that adapts to player actions.

Players summon monsters, cast spells, and manage limited resources as they battle through a dungeon filled with relentless enemies. Featuring a five-phase combat structure, a rich keyword system, and a point-driven AI evaluation model inspired by industry standards, Damnata offers a tense, skill-based experience where every decision carries weight.
